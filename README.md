# parser-for-learning-v2

This program takes a hex string of a bitcoin transaction and outputs its parts. I believe It can handle all transaction types.

It's purpose is educational, to reinforce what I have learned thus far about C++ and bitcoin transactions.

Every day is a learning day.

Compile with:

> make

Run with:

> ./parser [rawtransaction]
